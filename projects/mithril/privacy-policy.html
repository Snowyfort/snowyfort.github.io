    <br/>
    <p>This application accesses and interacts with data within the "Vaults" folder, 
        which is created within the user's "Documents" folder upon starting the app 
        for the first time. This application does not access the users personal data, 
        unless the data is stored within the application's "Vaults" folder. This 
        application will not ever send any data it accesses to any external servers 
        or services.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>This application is to be used at the users own risk. It may still contain 
        unknown bugs and errors which could potentially result in data loss; This is 
        why users are recommended to back up their data and make sure that the application 
        can successfully process it through encryption, by both encrypting the data 
        and decrypting it.</p>
